# OpenGL audio visualizer

## Introduction
This is a project I made in 2024 to apply what I learnt from the [LearnOpenGL.com](https://learnopengl.com/) tutorials and to extend the functionality of my previous [fft_player](https://github.com/Edward205/fft_player). It is also the first project where I attempted to use Git in order to track my changes. I also tried to use more OOP concepts to better organise my program. I'm publishing this to showcase my only practical OpenGL application.
